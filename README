the folder files structure here is the same as the previous projects and the examples provided by the teacher.
-bin : contain the executable files
-config : contain the flex/bison files 
-doc : contain the document about the project(like an experiment report)
-include : contain all the headers files for definitions...
-src : contain the source files
-test : contain the programs used to test the compiler
-interpreter : the interpreter folder


use make to compile an the run ("./C <input.c1"), then use the interpreter to interpret the genereted code "bincode" file.
